We are thrilled to present our final software engineering project, meticulously crafted by William and Bright Selorm Djogatse for the ALX Software Engineering Program. Throughout the development process, we poured our dedication and expertise into every line of code, ensuring a flawless backend that operates seamlessly and precisely as intended.

While we encountered some challenges on the frontend due to our specialization in backend engineering, we remained steadfast in our commitment to delivering excellence. Despite the looming deadline and the complexities of frontend development, our determination never wavered.

Although there may be a few lingering bugs in the frontend, rest assured that we are fully committed to returning to refine and perfect every aspect of this web application. Our dedication to continuous improvement drives us forward, and we are confident that with time and effort, we will overcome any obstacles in our path.

Thank you for the opportunity to showcase our skills and dedication to the craft of software engineering. We look forward to the journey ahead as we continue to grow and evolve in our development journey
